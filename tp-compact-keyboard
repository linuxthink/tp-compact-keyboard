--help
    Print this help output.

--fn-lock-disable
    Disable "fn key lock". The the function keys will send media function
    keycodes (such as mute audio).

--fn-lock-enable
    Enable "fn key lock". The function keys will send the F keycodes (IE F1,
    F2, etc).

--native-fn-enable
    By default, F7/F9/F11 generate a string of keypresses that might be
    useful under windows. This stops this, and instead only generates
    custom events.

--native-mouse-enable
    The middle button generates 2 events by default, but Linux only
    understands one of them. This disables the event that Linux does
    understand, leaving you with no middle button.

--native-mouse-disable
    Restore middle button to a working state.

--sensitivity xx
    Set sensitivity of trackpoint. xx is hex value 01--09 (although values
    up to FF work).
